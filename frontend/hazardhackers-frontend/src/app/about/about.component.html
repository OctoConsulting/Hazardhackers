        Background Information:

    <p class="content">Construction sites are inherently high-risk environments with a lot of coordinated moving parts.
      According to the Bureau of labor, the amount of nonfatal injuries in the United States for 2018 was 195,600 in construction.
      However, the average cost of recovery, such as medical and losses in wages, amounted to $27,000 per case. Workers may have to
      take unpaid leave to recover, or may be unable to return to work due to an accident.</p>
    <p class="content">In safety, there are three major ways to tackle a perceived problem, prevention, mitigation, and detection.
      Workplace inspectors have the tough job of identifying and reporting workplace incidents after the fact. But what if we told you
      that thereâ€™s a way to detect the problem before it happens using artificial intelligence?</p>
